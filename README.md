Basic steps:
1) Install torch, flask, flask_sqlalchemy, tqdm, transformers, PILLOW
2) Easiest way to get it to connect to tor is to just download the tor web browser and have it run in the background while this works.
3) Model files go in models/. I reccomend something like e621-l14-rhoLoss from here (needs both json and ckpt): https://github.com/feffy380/improved-aesthetic-predictor/tree/main/models
